# Level 1 React Component Exercises

### What is the difference between a regular function and an arrow function?
- The main differences between a regular function and an arrow function in JavaScript are:
  - Arrow functions have a shorter and more concise syntax.
  - Arrow functions do not bind their own `this` value, making them suitable for certain use cases in React components.
  - Arrow functions do not have their `arguments` object.

### What is a React Component?
- A React component is a reusable and self-contained building block of a user interface. It can represent a part of the user interface, handle its own state and props, and encapsulate its functionality.

### How do you make a React functional component?
- You can create a React functional component by defining a JavaScript function that returns JSX (HTML-like code). Functional components are created using the `function` keyword or arrow functions.

   Example:
   ```jsx
   function MyComponent() {
     return <div>Hello, I'm a functional component!</div>;
   }
   ```

### What is the difference between a pure JavaScript function and a functional component?
- A pure JavaScript function is a standard function in JavaScript that can perform any task. In contrast, a functional component is a specific type of function in React used for building user interface elements. Functional components return JSX and may have their own state and lifecycle methods.

### How small is a React component?
- The size of a React component can vary widely depending on its purpose and complexity. Components can be very small, representing a simple button or input field, or they can be larger, representing entire sections of a user interface. The size of a component should be determined by its responsibilities and reusability.

### Can we make a button or input field component?
- Yes, you can create React components for buttons, input fields, or any other UI elements. This is a common practice in React to encapsulate the behavior and appearance of these elements for reuse in various parts of your application.

### Make a reusable Button component.
- Here's an example of a reusable Button component:

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';

   function Button({ label, onClick }) {
     return <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>;
   }

   export default Button;
   ```

### Make a reusable InputField component.
- Here's an example of a reusable InputField component:

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';

   function InputField({ type, placeholder, value, onChange }) {
     return (
       <input
         type={type}
         placeholder={placeholder}
         value={value}
         onChange={onChange}
       />
     );
   }

   export default InputField;
   ```

### Make a reusable alert box component with one div parent element and one p child element of the div (warning alert box, success alert box).
- Here's an example of a reusable AlertBox component that can display warning and success messages:

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';

   function AlertBox({ type, message }) {
     const alertStyle =
       type === 'warning' ? 'alert warning' : type === 'success' ? 'alert success' : 'alert';

     return (
       <div className={alertStyle}>
         <p>{message}</p>
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default AlertBox;
   ```
   In this component, the `type` prop is used to determine the style of the alert box, and the `message` prop is used to specify the content of the alert.
```

You can copy and paste this content into a Markdown file and save it as a `.md` file for reference.
